The Merge Sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), 
where n represents the number of elements in the list. 
This time complexity is consistent as each split operation divides the list into two halves (O(log n)), 
and the merge operation takes linear time (O(n)). 
Merge Sort is an extremely efficient sorting algorithm for large data sets, 
and it is also a stable sorting algorithm that preserves the relative order of equal elements. 
Compared to other sorting algorithms like QuickSort, which can be faster in practice, 
Merge Sort has a consistent time complexity without degrading to O(n^2) in worst-case scenarios. 
Heapsort is another stable sorting algorithm with a similar time complexity to Merge Sort, but it can be less efficient in practice. 
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are less efficient for large lists with their O(n^2) time complexity.
